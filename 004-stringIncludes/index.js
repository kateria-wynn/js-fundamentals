/* 
Write a function called stringIncludes, which accepts two strings: the first string is a word and the second string is a single character.

The function should return true if the first string includes the character, otherwise it should return false.

Do not use the built in String.includes() function!

Examples:

stringIncludes('awesome', 'e'); // true
stringIncludes('awesome', 'z'); // false
*/
